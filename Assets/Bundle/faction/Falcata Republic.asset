  Description: "The Falcata Republic is a strong, unitary republic centered on the
    planet Strata in the Falcata system. From this seat of power, the Falcatan congress
    administers 15 major populated planets and many more minor outposts across 10
    different star systems. While its control is looser in its further reaches, the
    overall strength of Falcata is not doubted amongst the nations of the cluster.
    A Falcatan state has existed in one form or another for roughly 650 years, with
    the sole exception being its occupation by Imperial Venuma from -6 I.Y. - 77
    I.Y. The area of space controlled by Falcata was settled primarily by two groups,
    Anglois and Francois, and these two cultures have remained dominant in the region
    ever since. As such the republic is primarily a blingual state, with each group
    having roughly equal representation in congress. despite the fact that the Francois
    population is 10% smaller. \n\nBeing a unitary system, most laws and regulations
    are made applicable across the whole of Falcatan space, while this would be infeasable
    for most stellar polities, the smaller nature of the Falcatan state, combined
    with cutting edge hyperspace and communications technologies makes it a passible
    method of governing. Even still, unrest is common the further you go from the
    core, and many politicians are pressuring for a switch to a federative regime.
    \n\nFor most of recent history, Falcatan foreign policy has focused strongly
    on self preservation and cooperation with its allies. This was a natural result
    of the Venuman occupation, but as that war slips further and further into the
    past, congress has found more and more hawkish members entering its chambers.
    Many right wingers call for the initiation of a conflict in an attempt to further
    unify the republic, either against the increasingly authoritarian Indivism Technocracy
    to the north, or the long dominant Shelter Alliance to the southeast. \n\nThough
    Shelter and Falcata share an ideology, and were historical allies against Venuma.
    200 years with no common enemy saw discontent grow in Falcata and elsewhere against
    shelter dominion. This discontent lead to more abrasive diplomacy and rising
    tensions, eventually culminating in a small border skirmish which left 3 Falcatan
    bulk liners and a Shelter cruiser clouds of expanding gas. While the root cause
    of the skirmish is currently unknown, emotions ran high and relations were cut
    entirely. Now, as Shelter finds itself bogged down in the Bethel Rebellion, Falcata
    readies its fleet, lifting a knife set to plunge into Shelters exposed back...\n"
